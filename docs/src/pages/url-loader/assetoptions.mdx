# AssetOptions

Asset Options define the base properties that are shared across all image and video assets.

The majority of options are defined as part of this core set, but a few type-specific definitions are made available distinctly on the [ImageOptions](/imageoptions) and [VideoOptions](/videooptions) Types.

## Properties

<SchemaTable
  schema={zodToJsonSchema(assetOptionsSchema, "assetOptions")}
  schemaKey="assetOptions"
