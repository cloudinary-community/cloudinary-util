# Cloudinary Util

Cloudinary Util is a collection of libraries intended to help plugin or integration developers have an easier time working with Cloudinary.

It's based off of the idea of providing a more intuitive way to express transformations largely revolving around props-based APIs.

## Util Libraries

The current makeup of the Util libraries includes:

- URL Loader: primarily a single function that given a set of props, returns a Cloudinary URL
- Util: helpers for working with Cloudinary systems

The constructCloudinaryUrl function is designed to provide a consistent API for building URLs.

It's original design intent was to create a bridge between various frameworks such
as [Next.js](https://next.cloudinary.dev/), [Nuxt](https://cloudinary.nuxtjs.org/),
and [Svelte](https://svelte.cloudinary.dev/) to more easily create framework-first implementations
with the same experience between the projects.

In upcoming builds, similar functions will be created to allow similarly consistent props-based
designs for widget wrappers such as CldUploadWidget, CldVideoPlayer, and more.
