# Documentation

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies using pnpm

```shell copy
pnpm install
```

2. Build Cloudinary Util packages

This can be done in the root of the project by running:

```shell copy
pnpm build
```

Each package under the `packages` directory will be built, where these are then
pulled in automatically to help generate documentation.

3. Start development server

```shell copy
pnpm dev
```
